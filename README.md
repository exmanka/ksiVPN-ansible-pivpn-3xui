## Prerequisites
You should have at least one server with allowed SSH connection with installed pivpn or 3x-ui panels.

## Usage
1. Install Ansible according to the [official instructions](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#pip-install).

4. Move to project directory: `cd ksiVPN-ansible-pivpn-3xui`
5. Add your servers to file `hosts` according to template in file.
